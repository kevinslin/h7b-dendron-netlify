## Notes from reading

- Total Expense Ratio (TER)
- Assets under Management (AUM)
- Number of stocks (underlying portfolio of stocks in ETF)
- Trading Volume
    - it could be good to know that you can liquidate your shares at the best price
- Fund Domicile
- Dividend Distribution policy
- Replication Technique
    - **Physical replication** is safer than synthetic method
    - With Physical replication technique, prefer a **Full Replication** fund rather than a Sampling fund
- Tracking Difference and Tracking Error
- Historical Fund Returns
- Currency Hedging
- Bid/Ask spreads

> Note: I should write similar article for Vietnam markets.
